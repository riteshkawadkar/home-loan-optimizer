## 🎯 Problem Statement

Every homeowner with a loan faces this critical financial dilemma:

> **"I have ₹50,000 surplus every month. Should I prepay my home loan or invest it?"**

This decision is complex and involves multiple factors:
- **Interest saved** from prepayment vs **potential investment returns**
- **Tax benefits** (80C, 24b deductions) on both sides
- **Loan stage** (early vs late) and remaining tenure
- **Emergency fund** requirements and liquidity needs
- **Risk tolerance** and investment horizon
- **Opportunity cost** of locking money in loan prepayment

Most people make this decision based on gut feeling or generic advice. **Home Loan Optimizer** provides data-driven, personalized recommendations using AI-powered analysis.
