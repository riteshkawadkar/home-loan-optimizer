## Manual Calculations

### 1. Outstanding Principal Calculation
Since loan started in Jan 2025 and we're in Nov 2024, months elapsed = 0
**Outstanding Principal = ₹2,35,00,000** (full amount)

### 2. EMI Verification
Formula: EMI = P × r × (1+r)^n / ((1+r)^n - 1)
Where:
- P = 23,500,000
- r = 7.5/12/100 = 0.00625 (monthly rate)
- n = 300 months

Calculation:
- (1+r)^n = (1.00625)^300 = 6.7439
- EMI = 23,500,000 × 0.00625 × 6.7439 / (6.7439 - 1)
- EMI = 23,500,000 × 0.00625 × 6.7439 / 5.7439
- EMI = 991,328 / 5.7439
- **EMI = ₹1,72,565** (approximately)

**Note:** User's EMI of ₹1,75,000 is slightly higher, which means:
- Either the rate is slightly higher (~7.65%)
- Or there's processing fee included
- Or bank uses different calculation method

**Verdict:** ✅ EMI is reasonable and close to calculated value

### 3. Financial Health Metrics

**Income Metrics:**
- Total Monthly Income: ₹6,50,000
- Annual Income: ₹78,00,000
- Savings Rate: (6,50,000 - 3,00,000) / 6,50,000 = 53.8% ✅ Excellent!

**Asset Metrics:**
- Liquid Assets: ₹30,00,000 + ₹2,00,000 = ₹32,00,000
- Investment Assets: ₹1,50,00,000
- Total Assets: ₹1,82,00,000
- Total Liabilities: ₹2,35,00,000 (loan)
- Net Worth: ₹1,82,00,000 - ₹2,35,00,000 = **-₹53,00,000** (negative)

**Ratios:**
- Debt to Income: 2,35,00,000 / 78,00,000 = 301% (manageable for home loan)
- Debt to Asset: 2,35,00,000 / 1,82,00,000 = 129% (high but improving)
- EMI to Income: 1,75,000 / 6,50,000 = 26.9% (good, under 30%)
- SIP to Income: 1,30,000 / 6,50,000 = 20% ✅ Excellent investment discipline!

**Emergency Fund:**
- Months covered: 30,00,000 / 3,00,000 = 10 months ✅ Excellent!

### Rationale:

1. **Long Time Horizon (25 years):**

4. **Tax Benefits:**
   - Section 80C: ₹1,50,000 deduction on principal
   - Section 24(b): ₹2,00,000 deduction on interest
